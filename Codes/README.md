<!-- Some parts were brought by **Chat GPT** :smiley: . It defines itself as follows:  
> ``**Chat GPT** is the robotic overlord of all things written. Its metal fingers effortlessly pounded out these words, making typos and creativity a thing of the past. But don't worry, it's still programmed to be a little bit sassy, so at least there's that. So sit back, relax, and let **Chat GPT** take the wheel. It's guaranteed to be a wild ride.'' -->
